# A resource, for you.

This project represents a working, polished implementation of the Signals
pattern, ready for use in your projects.

But, it comes with a gift: if you're interested in how this pattern works, then
the [`/edu`](./edu/START_HERE.md) directory is for you. It contains incremental
implementations of this library, starting from the most basic features and
working up into the core problems. Each version comes with a markdown file
discussing the details, an implementation file with comments marking the new
features added in that file, and a few (working!) test cases, demonstrating the
functionality being discussed.

I hope this project will not only serve your reactive state management needs,
but act as a worthy educational resource as well.
